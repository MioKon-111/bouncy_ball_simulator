Bouncy Ball Simulator
A simple 2D bouncing ball simulation using Pygame.
This project simulates a ball falling under gravity with elastic collisions on the floor and horizontal walls.

Features
Simulates vertical free fall under gravity.

Horizontal motion with user-defined initial velocity.

Non-perfectly elastic collisions (coefficient of restitution).

User inputs for mass, elasticity, gravity, and initial horizontal velocity.

Visualization of the ball bouncing inside the window.
Requirements
Python 3.x

Pygame library
You can install Pygame via pip:
pip install pygame

Please enter the mass of the ball (kg): 5
Please enter the coefficient of restitution (0~1): 0.9
Please enter the gravitational acceleration (default 9.8): 9.8
Please enter the initial horizontal velocity (px/s): 10
